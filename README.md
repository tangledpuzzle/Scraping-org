We got a takedown request by openai's legal team...

here is a lil poem you can read in the meantime, while I am investigating it:

```
There once was a time, in a land full of code,
A little boy sat, in his humble abode.
He tinkered and toyed with devtools galore,
And found himself curious, and eager for more.

He copied and pasted, with glee and delight,
A personal project, to last him the night.
For use academic, and also for fun,
This little boy's race he just started to run.

Now quite far removed, in a tower so grand,
A company stood, it was ruling the land.
Their software was mighty, their power supreme,
But they never expected this boy and his dream.

As he played with their code, they then started to fear,
"His project is free! What of money so dear?"
They panicked and worried, their faces turned red,
As visions of chaos now filled every head.

The CEO paced, in his office so wide,
His minions all scrambled, and trying to hide.
"Who is this bad child?" he cried out in alarm,
"Our great AI moat, why would he cause harm?"

The developers gathered, their keyboards ablaze,
To analyze closely the boy's evil ways.
They studied his project, they cracked every tome,
And soon they discovered his small, humble home.

"We must stop him!" they cried, with a shout and a shiver,
"This little boy's Mᴀᴋɪɴɢ OUR COMPANY QUIVER!"
So they plotted and schemed to yet halt his advance,
To put an end to his dear digital dance.

They filed then with GitHub a claim most obscene,
"His code is not his," said the company team,
Because of the law, the Great Copyright Mess,
This little boy got his first takedown request.

Now new information we do not yet know,
But for the boy's good, we hope results show.
For the cause of the True, the Brave and the Right,
Till the long bitter end, will this boy live to fight.
